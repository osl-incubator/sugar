# Installation

## Stable release

To install sugar, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
$ pip install containers-sugar
```

Sugar is also available on conda-forge

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge containers-sugar
```

This is the preferred method to install sugar,
as it will always install the most recent stable release.

## From sources

The sources for sugar can be downloaded from
the [Github repo](https://github.com/osl-incubator/sugar.git).

You can either clone the public repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/osl-incubator/sugar.git
```

Or download the
[tarball](https://github.com/osl-incubator/sugar.git/tarball/main):

```bash
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/osl-incubator/sugar.git/tarball/main
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```bash
$ poetry install
```
